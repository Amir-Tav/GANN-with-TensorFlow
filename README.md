# FashionGAN: Generative Adversarial Network for Fashion Images

This repository demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating fashion images. The project covers all essential steps, from model building to training and evaluation.

---

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

Start by installing the required libraries and dependencies:

```bash
%pip install tensorflow matplotlib
Imported libraries include TensorFlow for model building and Matplotlib for visualization.
2. Building the Discriminator
The discriminator model is built using convolutional layers to differentiate between real and fake images:

python
Always show details

Copy code
def build_discriminator(): 
    model = Sequential()
    
    # First Conv Block
    model.add(Conv2D(32, 5, input_shape=(28,28,1)))
    model.add(LeakyReLU(0.2))
    model.add(Dropout(0.4))
    
    # Additional Conv Blocks...
    
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    
    return model
3. Constructing the Training Loop
The training loop involves defining optimizers and losses for both the generator and discriminator:

python
Always show details

Copy code
g_opt = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)
d_opt = Adam(learning_rate=0.00001)
g_loss = BinaryCrossentropy()
d_loss = BinaryCrossentropy()
Custom Training Step
A subclassed model is created to implement the custom training step:

python
Always show details

Copy code
class FashionGAN(Model): 
    def train_step(self, batch):
        # Training logic...
4. Training the Model
Train the GAN model using the defined training loop and monitor its performance:

python
Always show details

Copy code
hist = fashongnn.fit(ds, epochs=20, callbacks=[ModelMonitor()])
Performance Visualization
Loss metrics are plotted to evaluate training:

python
Always show details

Copy code
plt.plot(hist.history['d_loss'], label='d_loss')
plt.plot(hist.history['g_loss'], label='g_loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
5. Testing the Generator
Test the generator by generating new images and visualizing them:

python
Always show details

Copy code
imgs = generator.predict(tf.random.normal((16, 128, 1)))
Visualizing Generated Images
Images are displayed in a grid format for easy comparison:

python
Always show details

Copy code
fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=4, nrows=4, figsize=(10,10))
6. Saving the Models
Finally, save the generator and discriminator models for future use:

python
Always show details

Copy code
generator.save('generator.h5')
discriminator.save('discriminator.h5')
